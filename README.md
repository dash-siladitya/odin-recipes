# odin-recipes
Recipes Project from The Odin Project Foundations Course

This micro-project showcases the basic HTML that I learnt as part of The Odin Project Foundations Course.

It includes a Home Page containing a list of links to Recipe pages which I created. I got to learn how to write the HTML boilerplate code, use basic HTML elements like Headers, Paragraphs, Images, Hyperlinks, and Lists, and use appropriate attributes whereever necessary.

Another learning curve included getting hands-on with git commands and understanding how to write good commit messages.

To summariase, at the end of this micro-project, I have a better understanding of fundamental HTMl concepts, Git commands, and Git commit message conventions.
